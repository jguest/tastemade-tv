Please note: this is purely a proof of concept. I promise I am not trying to rip off anyone, but rather, harness powerful technology as a workaround for WebRTC not being supported in mobile browsers.

### device requirements
* camera: _ios_ or _android_ phones/tablets with **Instant Webcam** (download in app/play store, $0.99)
* web: a modern computer (this app is quite a load on the CPU) with a browser that supports web sockets. Chrome 36 on my MacBook Air is working like a dream.

### how to setup a channel
* name it: go to http://tastemadetv.herokuapp.com, login with your _Tastemade_ credentials and _Instant Webcam_ server address, and hit "new channel". Name your channel something really clever like "Seattle Sampler". 
* preparing to stream: hitting "open studio" will connect your computer with all specified cameras currently streaming. If any are missing, make sure the slave cameras are running _Instant Webcam_ and have the little red "stream" circle lit.
* switching cameras: the biggest video on the screen is what will be broadcasted live at any given moment during the stream. You can select a different camera by hitting the number key for the camera you want to select.
* broadcasting: hit "broadcast" to start streaming live to all tastemade.tv users!

### how to watch tastemade.tv
* browse by city
* a city network represents a parent to all current channel streams in that area
